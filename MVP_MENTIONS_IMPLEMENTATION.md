## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `/scripts/find-mentions.mjs`
**Purpose:** Discover project mentions across GitHub and web sources

**Features:**
- GitHub Code Search API integration with rate limit handling
- Searches for exact project references: `github.com/pompelmi/pompelmi`, `pompelmi/pompelmi`, `npm i pompelmi`
- Filters for markdown files and awesome/curated lists
- Supports optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var to increase rate limits (60/hr → 5000/hr)
- Smart source type classification (awesome-list, newsletter, directory, other)
- URL normalization and deduplication
- Stable sorting by type priority and date
- Outputs to `/mentions/mentions.json`

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/find-mentions.mjs
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx node scripts/find-mentions.mjs
```

### 2. `/scripts/render-mentions-readme.mjs`
**Purpose:** Convert mentions.json to markdown for README embedding

**Features:**
- Reads `/mentions/mentions.json`
- Groups mentions by type (awesome lists, newsletters, directories, other)
- Formats with title, URL, publisher, and date
- Generates `/mentions/MENTIONS.md`
- Shows last updated timestamp and mention count

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/render-mentions-readme.mjs
```

### 3. `/scripts/inject-mentions-readme.mjs`
**Purpose:** Inject mentions into README between markers

**Features:**
- Reads `/mentions/MENTIONS.md`
- Finds `<!-- MENTIONS:START -->` and `<!-- MENTIONS:END -->` markers in README
- Replaces content between markers with generated mentions
- Validates marker presence and order
- Preserves all other README content

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/inject-mentions-readme.mjs
```

  "mentions:update": "npm run mentions:find && npm run mentions:render && npm run mentions:inject"
}
```

## 📂 Directory Structure Created

```
mentions/
├── mentions.json       (generated by mentions:find)
└── MENTIONS.md        (generated by mentions:render)
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### First-Time Setup
1. Run the mentions discovery and update README:
   ```bash
   npm run mentions:update
   ```

2. (Optional) Set GitHub token for higher rate limits:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx npm run mentions:update
   ```

### Regular Updates
To refresh mentions (recommended: monthly or when you notice new features):
```bash
npm run mentions:update
```

### Individual Steps
If you need to run steps separately:
```bash
# Step 1: Find mentions (requires internet)
npm run mentions:find

# Step 2: Render to markdown
npm run mentions:render

# Step 3: Inject into README
npm run mentions:inject
```

## 🔍 Validation

### Scripts Validation
All scripts:
- ✅ Use ES Modules (`.mjs`)
- ✅ Have proper error handling
- ✅ Show user-friendly messages
- ✅ Support graceful degradation (e.g., missing GITHUB_TOKEN)
- ✅ Use Node.js built-in modules (fs/promises, path, url)
- ✅ Zero external dependencies

### README Validation
- ✅ All links work (internal anchors use proper IDs)
- ✅ Code examples are syntactically correct
- ✅ Framework-specific code matches official patterns
- ✅ Maintains consistent voice and style
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (centered sections, responsive images)

---

## 📝 Notes

### False Positives Prevention
The search queries specifically use exact project identifiers:
- `github.com/pompelmi/pompelmi` - Full GitHub URL
- `pompelmi/pompelmi` - Repo identifier
- `"npm i pompelmi"` - Install command
- `"npm install pompelmi"` - Install command variant

This avoids matching the fruit "pompelo/pamplemousse" and other false positives.

### Rate Limits
- **Without token:** 60 requests/hour (GitHub API)
- **With token:** 5,000 requests/hour (GitHub API)
- The script includes 1-second delays between requests to be respectful

### Reproducibility
All mentions are discovered programmatically via the scripts. No manual curation needed. Anyone can re-run `npm run mentions:update` to get the latest mentions.

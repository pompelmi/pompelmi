# HIPAA Compliance Implementation for Pompelmi Decompilation Engines

## Overview

This document outlines the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance measures implemented in Pompelmi's decompilation engines. These measures are critical because healthcare professionals regularly use this software to analyze malware and compromised systems that may contain Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Risk Assessment

Healthcare environments face unique security challenges when analyzing potentially malicious files:

1. **PHI Exposure Risk**: Malware samples may contain harvested patient data
2. **Log File Contamination**: Analysis logs could inadvertently capture sensitive information
3. **Temporary File Leakage**: Decompilation processes create temporary files that must be securely handled
4. **Error Message Exposure**: Stack traces and error messages may reveal system paths and user information
5. **Network Communication**: Analysis engines may attempt network communication that could expose internal infrastructure

## Implemented Security Controls

### 1. Data Sanitization

#### Filename Sanitization
- Original filenames are replaced with SHA-256 hash-based identifiers
- Only file extensions are preserved for analysis compatibility
- Implementation: `sanitizeFilename(filename?: string): string`

#### Error Message Redaction
- System paths are replaced with `[REDACTED_PATH]` placeholders
- Potential SSNs and IDs are masked with `[REDACTED_ID]`
- Email addresses are replaced with `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`
- Implementation: `sanitizeError(error: Error | string): string`

### 2. Secure Temporary File Handling

#### Secure Path Generation
- Cryptographically secure random identifiers for all temporary files
- Timestamped paths to prevent collisions
- Implementation: `createSecureTempPath(prefix?: string): string`

#### Guaranteed Cleanup
- Automatic cleanup in `finally` blocks regardless of analysis outcome
- Secure deletion attempts for all temporary files
- Implementation: `secureCleanup(filePath: string): Promise<void>`

### 3. Environment Sanitization

#### Environment Variable Filtering
- Removal of potentially sensitive environment variables:
  - `USERNAME` / `USER`
  - `HOME` / `USERPROFILE`
  - Other user-identifying variables
- Clean environment passed to analysis subprocesses

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging

#### Audit Event Types
- `decompilation_start`: Analysis initiation with session ID
- `decompilation_success`: Successful completion with result counts
- `decompilation_error`: Error events with sanitized error messages
- `decompilation_parse_error`: JSON parsing failures
- `decompilation_analysis_error`: Analysis engine failures  
- `decompilation_cleanup`: Secure cleanup completion
- `decompilation_cleanup_error`: Cleanup failures

#### Audit Data Structure
```typescript
{
  engine: 'binaryninja-hlil' | 'ghidra-pcode',
  sessionId: string,        // Cryptographically secure session identifier
  timestamp: string,        // Automatically added by logging system
  eventType: string,        // Event classification
  details: object          // Sanitized event-specific data
}
```

### 5. Session Management

#### Secure Session Identifiers
- 16-byte cryptographically random session IDs
- Used to correlate all events for a single analysis session
- Enables audit trail reconstruction while maintaining anonymity

## Engine-Specific Implementation

### Binary Ninja Engine (`packages/engine-binaryninja/`)

**Key Security Features:**
- HIPAA utilities integrated into `BinaryNinjaScanner` class
- Secure temporary file handling for binary samples and Python scripts
- Environment sanitization before subprocess execution
- Comprehensive error sanitization in all return paths
- Audit logging for all analysis phases

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.ts`: Core scanner with HIPAA compliance integration

### Ghidra Engine (`packages/engine-ghidra/`)

**Key Security Features:**
- HIPAA utilities integrated into `GhidraScanner` class
- Secure handling of Ghidra project directories and analysis scripts
- Java subprocess execution with sanitized environment
- JSON result parsing with error sanitization
- Audit logging throughout analysis lifecycle

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.ts`: Core scanner with HIPAA compliance integration

## Usage Guidelines

### For Healthcare Organizations

1. **Enable Audit Logging**: Ensure audit logs are captured and stored according to your organization's HIPAA policies
2. **Monitor Temporary Directories**: Regular monitoring of temp directory cleanup
3. **Log Review**: Periodic review of audit logs for potential security incidents
4. **Network Isolation**: Consider running analyses in isolated network environments
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep Pompelmi updated to receive latest security enhancements

### For Developers

1. **Error Handling**: Always use `hipaa.sanitizeError()` when logging or returning errors
2. **Temporary Files**: Use `hipaa.createSecureTempPath()` for all temporary file creation
3. **Cleanup**: Ensure `hipaa.secureCleanup()` is called in `finally` blocks
4. **Audit Events**: Log significant events using `hipaa.auditLog()`
5. **Environment**: Sanitize environment variables before subprocess execution

## Compliance Verification

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests verify sanitization functions work correctly
- Integration tests ensure proper cleanup under error conditions
- Mock auditing verifies complete event coverage

### Manual Review Points
1. Check that no actual filenames appear in logs
2. Verify temporary files are cleaned up after analysis
3. Confirm error messages don't expose system information
4. Review audit logs for complete session tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Encrypted Temporary Files**: AES encryption for temporary analysis files
2. **Advanced Audit Storage**: Integration with SIEM systems and secure log storage
3. **Network Monitoring**: Detection and blocking of unexpected network activity
4. **Memory Protection**: Secure memory handling to prevent information leakage
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of HIPAA compliance reports

### Configuration Options
Future versions will include configurable HIPAA compliance levels:
- `strict`: Maximum security with performance trade-offs
- `balanced`: Default security with reasonable performance
- `minimal`: Basic compliance for non-healthcare environments

## Contact and Support

For HIPAA compliance questions or to report potential security issues:
- Create a private security issue in the repository
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Include "HIPAA" in the issue title for priority handling
